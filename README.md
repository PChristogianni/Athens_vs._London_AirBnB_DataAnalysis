# Athens_vs._London_AirBnB_DataAnalysis
## Project overview
The goal of this project is to analyse and compare the AirBnB Dataset between the listing records of Athens, Greece and London, United Kingdom. Born and raised in Athens and currently working and living in London I was looking for interesting insights of this online rental marketplace that will be presented here via data cleaning, visualizations and exploratory data analysis.
## Process
* Data Collection
* Data Cleaning
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Data Modeling
## Analysis Topics
* Comparison between Athens vs. London data
* Which days/seasons most of the comments were given? Did it have to do with a specific season? Which months?/years?
* Is there a correlation between the No of reviews and the price?
* Is there a correlation between the room type and the price?
* Is there a correlation between the min nights of stay and the price?
* Is there a correlation between the min nights of stay and the room type? Eg Are whole-property-owners more likely to set more min nights?
